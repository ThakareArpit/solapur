        <p>
          The main entrance of Lord Vittala's Temple is facing towards the
          Chandrabhaga or Bhima river. Samadhi of Namadev and Chokamela is at
          the entrance. Pilgrims will first pray to the Devotees and then enter
          the temple. A small Ganesh Shrine is present inside the temple as
          first Shrine. Then, a small hall where bhajans are performed. A small
          Shrine for Garuda and Hanuman. Then, after climbing a few steps, we
          can see the face of Lord Vittala. We can have this Mukha Darshan any
          time without standing in Queue. For, Padha Darshan (To touch the Lotus
          Feet of Lord), there is an entrance which leads to the queue complex
          outside the temple. It will lead to many small shrines of Bhaktas,
          then towards the Lord Panduranga. We can touch the feet of Lord. We
          feel best when we touch the Lord's Lotus feet. There are Shrines for
          Rukmini Devi, Sathyabhama Devi, Radhika Devi, Lord Narasimha, Lord
          Venkateshwara, Goddess Mahalakshmi, Nagaraj, Ganesha, Annapoorna Devi.
          There is another mandap where all devotees play like Krishna had
          played with Gopikas. It is a great experience.

        <h2>Popular Places in Pandharpur</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Dindi Yatra</h3>
        <p>
          Ashadi Ekadasi is a religious procession and is celebrated during the
          months of June- July (Aashaadh Shukla paksha). It consists of a
          beautifully decorated Palkhi having the “padukas” of the lord and the
          Palkhi procession consists of people collectively walking, singing and
          dancing the glory of the Lord in what are called as ‘Dindis’. This is
          said to be the World's largest and oldest people movement where people
          gather on a specific day every year and perform a walk of a distance
          of around 250 km. Pandharpur Ashadi Ekadashi Wari journey has been
          honoured by World Book of Records, London under the title 'One of the
          Most visited places in a day
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Chandrabhaga River</h3>
        <p>
          The Bhima River (also known as Chandrabhaga River) is a major river in
          Western India and South India. It flows southeast for 861 kilometres
          (535 mi) through Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana states, before
          entering the Krishna River. After the first sixty-five kilometers in a
          narrow valley through rugged terrain,[1] the banks open up and form a
          fertile agricultural area which is densely populated
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Legend of Pundalik</h3>
        <p>
          Krishna was extremely impressed and the ever-loving God waited for his
          devotee. When Pundalik came out, he begged for pardon but far from
          being displeased, Krishna was taken over by Pundalik's love for his
          parents and granted a boon. Pundalik requested Krishna to stay back on
          Earth and bless all his true devotees. He agreed to take the form of
          Vithoba, or God who stood upon a brick, and a temple came up there.
          Along with Vithoba, Rukmini (Mother Rukmini, the consort of Krishna)
          is also worshipped here
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Sant Namdeva Maharaj Payari</h3>
        <p>
          An interesting tale is that of the temple's first step called “Sant
          Namdev Maharaj Payari” (step of Sant Namdev Maharaj). The child and
          future saint, Namdev was an ardent devotee of Vithoba. One day his
          mother asks him to complete the ritual of “naivedya” (any food made in
          the house is first offered to God, the ritual comprises placing the
          offering plate before the deity and sprinkling water around the plate
          and with a prayer to God). Namdev faithfully does “naivedya” and waits
          for God to appear and take the offering. But he is disheartened. He
          keeps praying and requests God to come in person and accept the
          offering. With no answer, the child starts banging his head at the
          feet of God. Seeing this utmost devotion and innocence of a child, God
          appears, eats the offering and blesses Namdev. Namdev asks for being
          present in the "first step" at His temple, so that he could
          innumerable devotees will touch him before having the “darshan”
          (view). So, this first step is called “Sant Namdev Maharaj Payari”.
