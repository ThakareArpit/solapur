        <p>
          The fort is located near the Siddheshwar Temple of Lingayats and a
          lake passes by which also doubles up as a picnic spot. Right outside
          the premises of the fort is where history meets the 21st century.
          There is a nice lush green lawn, fountain and even a walking track
          that tourists can spend time after visiting the fort.
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1659, after the death of the Bijapur general Afzal Khan, in the
          ensuing confusion Shivaji took Panhala from Bijapur. In May 1660, to
          win back the fort from Shivaji, Adil Shah II (1656â€“1672) of Bijapur
          sent his army under the command of Siddi Johar to lay siege to
          Panhala. Shivaji fought back and they could not take the fort. The
          siege continued for 5 months, at the end of which all provisions in
          the fort were exhausted and Shivaji was on the verge of being
          captured.

        <h2>Major Features</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Solapur has a fort known as Bhuikot fort ( bhui means land and kot
          means fort - as this fort was built on land as against the other forts
          in Maharashtra built on hills !!). by Adil Shah. The fort later came
          under Maratha control.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Things to see</h3>
        <p>
          1] The grounds, known to host wrestling matches. <br />
          2] The Iconic Shiva temple. <br />
          3] A small animal park housing several rabbits, ducks, peacocks and
          other animals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!--<h3>Kalavanticha Mahal</h3>
        <p>
          Kalvanticha Mahal (The courtesan's palace) The name of this building,
          which is also called Nayakini Sajja, literally means "Courtesans'
          Terrace room". It stands on the east side of the fort close to the
          rampart. By 1886, it had become a complete wreck with only traces of
          ornamental work on the ceiling. This was used during the occupation of
          the fort by the Bahmani Sultanate as a Rang Mahal(residences for the
          ladies of the court)
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Ambarkhana</h3>
        <p>
          The Amberkhana, situated in the center of the fort, were three
          granaries built in the Bijapuri style of architecture. They enabled
          Shivaji to withstand a 5-month siege by Siddhi Johar. It consists of
          three buildings called the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati Kothis.
