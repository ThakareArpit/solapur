        <p>
          Ujjani Dam, also known as Bhima Dam or Bhima Irrigation Project, on
          the Bhima River, a tributary of the Krishna River, is an earthfill cum
          Masonry gravity dam located near Ujjani village of Madha Taluk in
          Solapur district of the state of Maharashtra in India. The Bhima
          River, which originates in Bhimashankar of the Western Ghats, and
          forms the Bhima Valley with its tributary rivers and streams, has
          twenty-two dams built on it of which the Ujjani Dam is the terminal
          dam on the river and is the largest in the valley that intercepts a
          catchment area of 14,858 km2 . The construction of the dam project
          including the canal system on both banks was started in 1969 at an
          initial estimated cost of Rs 400 million and when completed in June
          1980 the cost incurred was of the order of Rs 3295.85 million.

        <h2>Major Features</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Hydropower</h3>
        <p>
          A pumped storage type powerhouse has been built at the toe of the dam
          with an installed capacity of 12 MW (one unit of vertical
          Francis-reversible pump turbine) on the left bank of the dam, 65 m
          (213 ft) downstream from the axis of the dam.[15] It operates under 20
          percent load factor under a range of maximum head of 36.77 m (120.6
          ft) and minimum head of 25.6 m (84 ft).[1][16] The hydropower
          component involved construction of a 13.42 m (44.0 ft) high weir, 915
          m (3,002 ft) below the Ujjani Dam to control the lower pond for
          operation during the pumping mode.

        <br />

        <h3>Water Quality</h3>
        <p>
          Ujjani dam has a very bad quality of water. Ujjani dam contains
          hazardous pollutants from Pune and many other small cities located on
          the banks of bhima river or its tributaries. According to recent
          surveys the water from ujjani dam is not potable and should not be
          used for agriculture also. Dissolved oxygen is also below standard of
          8 ppm. Resident of Indapur taluka in pune district have been suffering
          from various ailments for the last four or five years the reason was
          unearthed during recent survey and testing of water at ujjani dam
          which residents dependent on the survey found high level of nitrates,
          chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in
          the water which makes it unfit for consumption .
