          Swami Samarth, also known as Swami of Akkalkot, was an Indian
          spiritual master of the Dattatreya Tradition. He is a widely known
          spiritual figure in various Indian states including
          Maharashtra,India.[6] He lived during the nineteenth century. Swami
          Samarth traveled all across the Indian subcontinent and eventually set
          his abode at Akkalkot, a village in present-day Maharashtra. He is
          thought to have initially arrived at Akkalkot on a Wednesday, during
          either September or October in 1856. He resided at Akkalkot for close
          to 22 years. His parentage and origins remain obscure. Some other
          Indian saints and spiritual figures including Sai Baba of Shirdi and
          Gajanan Maharaj of Shegaon also have similarly unknown origins.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          AKKALKOT a Maratha state is situated in Maharashtra state of India. In
          early 17th century it was a part of Nizamshahi territory. Later it was
          part of Mughal Empire, it was later given as grant to Shahu Maharaj,
          The Maratha King who then transferred it to founder of the Akkalkot
          dynasty. Shahu Chatrapati was the grandson of Chatrapati Shivaji
          Maharaj, founder of Maratha Empire who died in 1680 leaving two sons
          namely Chatrapti Sambhaji and Rajaram Maharaj. The elder son Chatrapti
          Sambhaji was slain by Aurangzeb and his son Chatrapati Shahu was made
          a prisoner. After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, Chatrapati Shahu was
          liberated and he returned to claim his Maratha Kingdom but was opposed
          by Tarabai, the widow of Rajaram Maharaj, who was ruling the Maratha
          Empire in his absence..

        <h3>Life</h3>
        <p>
          According to Swami Samarth himself, he had originally appeared in the
          Kardali forests near Srisailam, a Hindu holy town in present-day
          Andhra Pradesh. He might have moved through China, Tibet and Nepal
          during his travels across the Himalayas and its adjacent regions. He
          is also believed to have visited various Indian regions such as Puri,
          Varanasi (also Kashi), Haridwar, Girnar, Kathiawar and Rameswaram. He
          might have also briefly lived at Mangalvedha, a town near Pandharpur
          in present-day Solapur district, Maharashtra. He finally settled at
          Akkalkot.
